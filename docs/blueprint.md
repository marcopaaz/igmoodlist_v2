# **App Name**: igmoodlist

## Core Features:

- AI Playlist Generation: Generate a 10-song playlist based on an Instagram profile's mood using AI analysis and the Spotify API. The AI tool will use its judgment to decide which information about the Instagram profile is relevant to the playlist creation.
- Instagram Input: Allow users to input their Instagram handle, or upload an image from their profile, to kick off the playlist generation. Instagram will be scraped using Apify Scraper.
- Shareable Image Generation: Enable users to create a shareable image for Instagram featuring the generated playlist.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) for a calm and creative feel.
- Secondary color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Mobile-first responsive design with a focus on readability and easy navigation.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for playlist actions and social sharing.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.

## Original User Request:
I want to create a responsive website (will be used mostly on mobile), where people can input their Instagram Handle or upload pictures, and then using Apify Instagram Scraper, as well as Spotify API and AI generate a Playlist of 10 songs based on the mood of their instagram profile. That needs to have the option to either generate an image for instagram sharing or save the playlist to spotify.
